## Testing Checklist

## Known Issues & Notes

### Multi-language Content
- Frontend is English-only for users
- Admin pages support Korean/English toggle
- MyPageWithWithdrawal.jsx still contains Korean/Japanese text in translation objects
  - This is intentional for multi-language support structure
  - Does not affect English-only user experience

### Dependencies
- Using `--legacy-peer-deps` due to date-fns version conflict
- This is safe and does not affect functionality
- Consider updating react-day-picker in future

### Stats Multiplier
- Implemented for better presentation of follower counts
- Configurable in admin settings
- See `STATS_MULTIPLIER_GUIDE.md` for details
